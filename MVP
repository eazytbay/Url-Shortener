Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for URL Shortener Web Application
Introduction
This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for my URL shortener web application. The focus is on delivering core functionalities with a user-friendly interface, ensuring a successful initial deployment and user testing phase.
User Experience (UX) Goals
Simple and Intuitive: The application will have a clean and uncluttered interface for easy URL submission and shortened link display.
Accessibility: The application will be accessible without requiring user account creation or personal information disclosure. This caters to a wider audience and streamlines the user experience for potential employers evaluating my skills.
MVP Scope
URL Shortening: Users can submit long URLs through a designated input field.
Unique Short Code Generation: The application will generate unique and random short codes for each submitted URL.
Redirection: Clicking on a shortened URL will automatically redirect the user to the original long URL.
User Interface: A basic web interface will allow users to interact with the application for submitting URLs and viewing shortened versions.
Development Shortcuts
Database (Optional): For the initial MVP, I may explore using a lightweight file system approach (like storing shortened URLs and mappings in a text file) instead of a full-fledged database like MySQL. This simplifies initial development and allows me to focus on core functionalities. However, I will clearly document this as a shortcut and plan to migrate to a database in future iterations for scalability and improved data management.
Testing and Deployment
I will perform thorough unit testing of individual functionalities to ensure they work as expected.
Manual testing will simulate user interactions and various scenarios to identify potential usability issues or edge cases.
Once testing is complete, I plan to deploy the application to a free hosting platform like Heroku for easy accessibility and demonstration purposes.
Documentation
I will create clear and concise documentation outlining the project goals, architecture, and functionalities. This will be helpful for future development and potential improvements.
Success Criteria
A successful MVP launch will include: 
A functional URL shortener web application with core functionalities.
A user-friendly interface that allows users to easily submit URLs and access shortened links.
Successful deployment to a public platform for demonstration purposes.
2. Architecture




APIs and Methods: Streamlined Communication Channels
My URL shortener MVP will leverage a well-defined set of APIs to facilitate seamless communication between the web client (user interface) and the web server. Here's a breakdown of the core functionalities I envision:
1. Shorten URL (POST /shorten):
This API route is the heart of the application. When a user submits a long URL through the web interface, the web client will utilize a POST request to this endpoint. The request body will contain the long URL as the payload.
Personal Touch:  This API route is designed with user experience in mind. The POST method ensures a clean separation of concerns and prevents sensitive data (long URLs) from being exposed in the URL itself.



2. Retrieve Shortened URL (GET /:shortCode):
This API route caters to the redirection functionality. When a user clicks on a shortened URL (containing the short code), the web client will trigger a GET request to this endpoint. The :shortCode portion of the URL will be dynamically replaced with the actual short code received.
Personal Touch:  I've opted for a user-friendly approach by utilizing a simple and intuitive route structure that leverages a placeholder for the short code.  This makes it easier for users to understand and potentially even predict the format of shortened URLs.
3. Error Handling (Various Status Codes):
While I strive to create a robust application, unforeseen situations can arise.  Therefore, I plan to implement a comprehensive error handling mechanism through various HTTP status codes.
Personal Touch:  I go the extra mile!  Beyond generic error messages, I aim to provide detailed and informative error codes that indicate the specific issue encountered. This will assist with debugging and troubleshooting any potential problems.
4. Future Considerations:
These initial API routes provide a solid foundation for the MVP.  Looking ahead, I envision potential future enhancements:
Shortened URL Statistics (GET /:shortCode/stats): This route could provide valuable data on the number of clicks a shortened URL receives, offering insights into user engagement.
Custom Short Code Generation (POST /shorten/custom): This feature would allow power users to create custom short codes for better organization and branding. Some of these area future additions to my Url  web application.
My Commitment:
These API routes represent a starting point, and I'm committed to continuously refining and expanding them as the application evolves.  My aim is to build a web app with a  good user experience and one thatâ€™s  user friendly.





Data Modelling

User Stories 
Deborah Joshua: As a content creator who juggles multiple social media platforms, I need a way to quickly shorten long URLs directly within my workflow. I want to enter a long URL in a dedicated field on my web interface. Once I click "Shorten," the application should validate the URL and, if it's legit, generate a unique and random short code. The shortened URL, combining the short code with my application's base domain, should be displayed right there on the same webpage. This way, I can easily copy and paste it for sharing on Twitter, Facebook, or wherever my content shines.
Acceptance Criteria:
My web interface must have a clear and readily accessible field for pasting long URLs.
The application should validate the URL format (like HTTP or HTTPS) to avoid any hiccups.
When I submit a valid URL, a one-of-a-kind short code should be generated on the spot.
The shortened URL, made by combining the short code with my application's domain, should be displayed prominently on the webpage.
The user interface should offer a user-friendly way for me to copy the shortened URL, like a handy "Copy" button.
Isaac Aboderin: For me, every Click Counts: Imagine I've shortened a URL, and now it's time to share! Whether I click on the shortened URL displayed on my webpage or encounter it anywhere online pointing back to my application, I want the experience to be seamless. The application should recognize the short code embedded within the shortened URL and automatically redirect me to the original long URL I submitted earlier.
Acceptance Criteria:
Clicking on a shortened URL (containing the short code) should trigger a request straight to my application's server.
The application should identify the short code within the shortened URL, like a secret handshake.
It should then look up the long URL associated with that specific short code in the data storage solution (file system for the MVP).
Upon successful retrieval, the application should initiate a redirection process, sending my browser directly to the original long URL.
Femi James:  As someone who values privacy, I want the application to display a clear and concise privacy policy. This policy should outline how my data, such as the long URLs I submit, is stored and used.
Acceptance Criteria:
My application should have a dedicated section or webpage specifically for its privacy policy.
The policy should be written in clear and easy-to-understand language, ditching the technical jargon.
It should explain what data is collected (long URLs in the MVP), how it's used (for shortening purposes only), and for how long it's retained.
The policy should also outline my rights regarding my data, such as the ability to request deletion if needed.
These user stories prioritize a user-centric approach, ensuring my URL shortener MVP offers a functional, efficient, and privacy-conscious experience for content creators like myself.


Conclusion
 This MVP approach ensures a focused and achievable development process for the URL shortener application.
